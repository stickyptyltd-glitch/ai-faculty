# AI Faculty — Continuity Log

Rule: **never overwrite — version forward.** Every meaningful change is recorded here.

---

## v0.1 — 2026-09-01 — Repo established, project absorbed

- Created standalone repo at `/home/dayle/projects/ai-faculty` (separate from MindMend).
- Absorbed the full architecture from the shared ChatGPT thread → `docs/PROJECT-BRIEF.md`.
- Seeded core design docs:
  - `00-constitution.md` v0.1
  - `01-architecture.md` v0.2 (7 control layers + Institutional AI Control Plane)
  - `02-faculty-roles.md` v0.2 (10 roles named)
  - `03-competency-framework.md` v0.1 (AI-Assisted Workflow Designer, C1–C7)
  - `04-learning-engine.md` v0.1 (Phase 2 engines)
  - `05-governance-decision-rights.md` v0.1 (8 decision classes, Assessment Resolution Protocol)
  - `06-faculty-growth-and-compensation.md` v0.1
  - `07-research-protocol.md` v0.1 (R0–R5)
  - `missions/mission-006-founder-response.md` (draft A–E)

## v0.2 — 2026-09-01 — First working software slice

- Added `app/` — a no-build, mobile-first web app (HTML/CSS/vanilla JS, `localStorage` persistence).
- Implements the first vertical slice of the Learning Engine:
  diagnostic intake → Learner Intelligence Model (C1–C7 capability state) → Pathway Engine
  (next best action) → a teach → practice → evidence → mastery loop for competency **C1 (Goal
  Definition)** → the 8-panel Progress view.
- Faculty responses are authored content for now, behind a `faculty.js` seam that a model/Control
  Plane can replace later.

## v0.3 — 2026-09-01 — Practical assessment model + Applied Projects

- `docs/08-assessment-model.md` — practical assessment & applications model.
- App: **banded rubric scoring** (Not yet / Developing / Meets / Exceeds) replacing binary pass/fail.
- App: **Assessment Resolution Protocol** surfaced — checkpoints offer an independent second
  assessment at a stricter bar; evidence records whether assessors 1 + 2 agreed.
- App: **Applied Projects** — learners register real projects, attach challenge/checkpoint evidence
  to them, and a project becomes "Demonstrated" once evidence spans all seven competencies. New
  Projects view; evidence portfolio grouped by project; Applications panel on the progress view.

## v0.4 — 2026-09-01 — Real lessons, clearer tasks, visual play-through

- Founder feedback: "be clearer about what to do; it must actually teach, not just set
  unclear tasks; the point is rapid learning via a great curriculum and real-world examples;
  short visual clips would help."
- Every competency (C1–C7) rebuilt as a **5-step lesson**: Why it matters (a real story of the
  skill failing) → The idea (model + boxed key idea) → **Watch it done** (a worked real-world
  example with the thinking shown) → The moves → **Your turn, guided** (supported attempt on a
  provided task, model answer shown next to the learner's, field by field). Challenges only open
  after the lesson.
- Every challenge/checkpoint now leads with a **"what a strong answer looks like"** panel and the
  worked example one click away. Field hints rewritten with concrete "e.g." examples.
- **Visual learning aid:** "Watch it done" has a ▶ play-through that reveals the worked example
  step by step on a timer with a progress bar (a lightweight stand-in for real short video clips,
  which are a later production asset).

## Open threads
- **Short video clips** — real filmed/animated clips per lesson are a future production asset;
  the SVG/CSS play-through is the interim.

- Mission 006 answers are drafts — founder to review and ratify → promotes `05` to a firmer version.
- Faculty role full specs (mission/scope/boundaries/…) still to be written.
- Authored content for C2–C7 still to be written.
- LLM/Control-Plane integration for live faculty responses not yet built.
